# About
This started out as a way to make it easy to test the logstash configuration for people without much linux know-how. Then it kind of grew into an interface, and then here we are.
It's written fast and the code could use a bit of additional love, but it should work fine.

## How to start
Documentation on how to get going is available here: https://loadbalancing.se/2020/03/11/logstash-pipeline-tester/

## Contributions
I gladly accept pull requests.

## Reporting issues
First, please check if there's any [current issues](https://github.com/epacke/logstash-pipeline-tester/issues) that matches your problem. If not, please feel free to submit an issue here at Github.

I have very limited time so I won't be able to act fast on any issue but it's always good to have it logged and who knows, maybe someone else will pick it up and make a PR.

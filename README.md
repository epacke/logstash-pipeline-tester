# About
This started out as a way to make it easy to test the logstash configuration for people without much linux know-how (and from my own frustration with how hard it was). Then it kind of grew into an interface, and here we are.

It's written fast and the code could use a bit of additional love, but it works fine.

## How to start
Documentation on how to get going is available here:
